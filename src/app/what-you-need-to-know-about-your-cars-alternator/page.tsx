    question: "What are the signs of a bad alternator?",
    answer: "Common signs include a battery warning light, dim or flickering lights, strange noises, burning smells, stalling, and a battery that keeps going flat.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a bad alternator drain a battery?",
    answer: "Yes. If the alternator is not charging properly, the battery will not be replenished and will eventually go flat. A faulty alternator can also sometimes drain a battery when the car is off.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does an alternator last?",
    answer: "It varies, but many last for many years. Lifespan depends on the vehicle, driving conditions and maintenance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I drive with a failing alternator?",
    answer: "Only for a very short distance, if at all. The car will run on battery power, and may stop without warning. It is best to get it checked straight away.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will a jump start fix a bad alternator?",
    answer: "No. It may get the engine running, but it does not repair the fault, and the car may die again soon after.",

    question: "Do you repair alternators?",

                Most drivers know that a car has a battery. Far fewer think about the alternator,
                until the day it fails. A faulty alternator can leave you with a flat battery,
                flickering lights, and a car that will not start or even stops while you are
                driving.

                <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  The alternator is a small generator driven by the engine, usually via a belt.
                  While the engine is running, it:

                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  In simple terms: the battery starts the car, and the alternator keeps it running
                  and keeps the battery topped up. If the alternator stops doing its job, the car
                  is effectively running on battery power alone, and that will not last long.

                  A mechanic or auto electrician can test both the battery and the charging system
                  with the right equipment. As a rough guide, many garages check that the system
                  is charging at a voltage higher than the battery&apos;s resting voltage while
                  the engine is running, but exact values depend on the vehicle, so leave testing
                  to a professional if you are unsure.

                <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  Often, yes. A jump start can get the engine running, but it does not fix the
                  underlying problem. If the alternator is not charging the battery, the car may
                  run for a short time and then die again. Repeated jump starts can also put
                  strain on the battery and electrical system.

                  The alternator is a small part with a big job. When it fails, you can quickly
                  lose power, the battery will go flat and you could end up stranded. Learn the
                  warning signs, do not ignore the battery light and get problems checked early.
