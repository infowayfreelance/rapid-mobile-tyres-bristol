    title: "2. Increased Risk of Aquaplaning",
    body: "Aquaplaning happens when a layer of water builds up between the tyre and the road, and the tyre loses contact. With shallow tread, the tyre cannot clear water fast enough, so the car can suddenly feel like it is floating, and steering and braking become ineffective.",

    question: "How can I check my tyre tread at home?",
    answer:
      "Use the 20p test: place a 20p coin in the main tread grooves. If the outer band of the coin is visible, the tyre may be at or near the legal limit and should be checked. You can also look at the tread wear indicators in the grooves.",
  },
  {
    question: "When should I replace my tyres?",
    answer:
      "You must replace them before they drop below 1.6mm, but many experts recommend replacing them earlier, at around 3mm, for better wet-weather safety.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the penalty for driving with illegal tyres?",
    answer:
      "You can face fines of up to £2,500 and 3 penalty points per illegal tyre. It can also affect your insurance and MOT.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do tyres wear out with age even if there is plenty of tread?",
    answer: "Yes. Rubber degrades over time. Have older tyres inspected, and check the age code on the sidewall.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I just replace one worn tyre?",
    answer:
      "Sometimes, but it depends on the condition of the others and your vehicle. A fitter can advise you, as replacing in pairs on the same axle is often recommended.",
  },

    question: "Can you replace worn tyres at my home in Bristol?",

                Your tyres are the only part of your car that touches the road. Each tyre&apos;s
                contact patch is roughly the size of the palm of your hand, and that small area
                handles your steering, braking, acceleration and grip. When tyres wear down, they
                cannot do that job properly.

                Many drivers put off replacing tyres because they still seem &quot;fine&quot;, or
                because the cost is off-putting. But driving on worn tyres puts you, your
                passengers and other road users at risk, and it can land you with a fine. This
                guide explains the dangers, the UK rules, how to check your tyres, and when to

                <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  The grooves in your tyre tread have an important job: they channel water away
                  from the contact patch so the rubber can grip the road. As the tread wears down,
                  the tyre can shift less water, which affects:

                  The legal limit is a minimum, not a recommendation. Many tyre experts and safety
                  organisations advise replacing tyres earlier, at around 3mm, because wet-weather
                  braking performance drops off noticeably as the tread wears down. If you drive a
                  lot in wet or wintry conditions, or at higher speeds, earlier replacement is a
                  sensible safety choice.

                    <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                      Check your tyre pressure regularly, including the spare if you have one. The
                      correct pressure is listed in your vehicle handbook or on a label inside the
                      door or fuel flap. Under-inflated tyres wear faster, overheat more easily
                      and can affect handling.

                    <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                      Tyres degrade with age, even if they have plenty of tread left. The date of
                      manufacture is shown on the sidewall as a four-digit code (week and year).
                      Many manufacturers and experts advise having older tyres inspected regularly
                      and replacing them when they reach around ten years, although the right time
                      depends on condition and storage. If you are unsure, ask a professional to
                      check.

                  Replacing tyres on your own schedule, rather than waiting for a failure, has
                  real benefits:

                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  If you only need one tyre replaced, it is also worth asking your fitter about
                  whether replacing in pairs on the same axle makes sense, for even handling.

                <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  Worn tyres are one of the most avoidable safety risks on the road. Longer
                  stopping distances, a higher risk of aquaplaning, poor handling and the chance
                  of fines are all good reasons not to put off a replacement. Check your tyres
                  regularly, replace them in good time, and do not wait for a failure to force the
                  issue.
