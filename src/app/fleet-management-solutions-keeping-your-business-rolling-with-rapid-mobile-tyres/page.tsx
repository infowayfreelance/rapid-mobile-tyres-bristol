                If your business depends on vehicles, tyres are not a small detail. A single flat
                or worn tyre can take a van off the road, delay deliveries, disappoint customers
                and cost you money. For businesses running vans, company cars or service vehicles,
                good tyre management is one of the simplest ways to protect your time and your
                budget.

                <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 leading-7 text-zinc-600">

                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  Driving with illegal tyres can lead to penalty points and fines, and the person
                  responsible for the vehicle can be held accountable. Businesses that run
                  vehicles should make regular tyre checks part of their routine. For commercial
                  vehicles, check current guidance from the DVSA and your insurer on inspection
                  and record-keeping duties.

                <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  Consider what happens when a van gets a flat tyre in a traditional setup:

                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  Even a few hours of lost time per incident adds up quickly, especially if you
                  run several vehicles. Mobile tyre fitting shortens this process dramatically.
