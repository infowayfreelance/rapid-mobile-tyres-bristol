    question: "Can I jump start my own car?",

      "Yes, in many cases, if you have working jump leads or a jump starter pack, you follow the correct steps and your vehicle allows it. Always check your handbook, and call for help if you are unsure.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which jump lead goes on first?",
    answer:
      "Typically, the red clamp goes on the flat battery's positive terminal first, then the good battery's positive terminal. Then the black clamp goes on the good battery's negative terminal, and the final black clamp goes on bare metal on the dead car. Always follow your vehicle's instructions.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long should I leave the engine running after a jump start?",
    answer:
      "Many sources suggest driving for around 20 to 30 minutes, but it varies. If the battery keeps going flat, have it tested.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I jump start a hybrid or electric car?",
    answer:
      "It depends on the model. Many have specific instructions or restrictions, so check your handbook. If you are unsure, call a professional.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does my car click but not start?",
    answer:
      "A clicking sound when you turn the key is commonly a sign of a flat battery, but it can also point to a starter or connection problem.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will jump starting damage my car?",

                    <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                      Park the working car close to the dead one so the leads reach, but make sure
                      the vehicles are not touching. Switch off both engines, apply the handbrakes,
                      put both cars in neutral (or park for automatics), and turn off all
                      electrics such as lights, radio and heating.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                      Step 2: Open the Bonnets and Find the Batteries
                    </h3>
                    <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                      Locate both batteries and identify the positive (+, usually red) and
                      negative (−, usually black) terminals. If the battery is hidden, your
                      handbook may show remote jump-start terminals under the bonnet.

                      Step 3: Connect the Leads in the Correct Order
                    </h3>
                    <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">The order matters. A common sequence is:</p>

                      Make sure the clamps are firmly attached and the metal parts of the clamps

                      Start the engine of the good car and let it run for a few minutes. This
                      sends charge to the flat battery. Some people gently raise the revs
                      slightly, but follow your handbook where it gives different advice.

                    <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                      Try starting the flat car. If it does not start after a few attempts, do not

                      try again. If it still does not work, the problem may be more than a flat

                      suggested guide, though it depends on the vehicle. Avoid switching the
                      engine off straight away.

                  A car that won&apos;t start is stressful, but a flat battery is one of the most
                  common and fixable causes. With the right equipment, a safe approach and the

                  unsure at any point, or the situation is unsafe, call a professional rather than
                  take a risk.
