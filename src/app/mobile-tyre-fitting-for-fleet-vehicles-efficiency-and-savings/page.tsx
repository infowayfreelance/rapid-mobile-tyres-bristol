                Every hour a vehicle spends off the road is an hour it is not earning, and tyre

                  Where Fleet Tyre Costs Really Come From
                </h2>
                <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  Most businesses think of tyre costs as the price of the tyre. In reality, that
                  is only one part. The full cost of a tyre job usually includes:
                </p>
                <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 leading-7 text-zinc-600">

                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  When you add these up, the &quot;cheapest&quot; tyre quote is not always the
                  cheapest option.

                <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  You can estimate the savings for your own fleet with a simple formula. Here is
                  an illustrative example only, using made-up figures. Replace them with your own.

                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  These numbers are only an example, and your actual savings will depend on your
                  business, vehicles and how often tyre work is needed. The point is that time
                  saved often outweighs small differences in tyre price.

                  For fleets, the real cost of a tyre job is not just the tyre. It is the time,

                  tyre habits help you avoid many emergencies altogether. When you add it up, the
                  savings in time and disruption can be significant.
