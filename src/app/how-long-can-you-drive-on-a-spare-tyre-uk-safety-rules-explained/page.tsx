  },
  {
    question: "Is it illegal to drive on a space-saver?",

      "It is not illegal in itself to use one as intended, but your vehicle must remain safe and roadworthy. Ignoring the manufacturer's speed and distance limits could make your driving unsafe.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I drive on a spare tyre on the motorway?",

      "It is best avoided. A temporary spare has a low speed limit, which can make you a hazard on fast roads. If possible, take a slower route to a safe place and arrange a proper replacement.",

                You have had a flat, put the spare on, and now you are wondering: how long can I

                puncture, and the answer matters. A spare tyre, especially a temporary one, is
                built to get you to safety, not to carry on as normal.

                <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  For a temporary &quot;space-saver&quot; spare, most manufacturers recommend:

                <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  <li>A maximum speed of around 50 mph (80 km/h)</li>
                  <li>A limited distance, often in the region of 50 to 100 miles, though this varies by vehicle</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  A full-size spare that matches your other tyres can generally be used as a
                  normal tyre, but it should still be checked and you should replace or repair the
                  damaged tyre as soon as you can.

                  printed on the spare&apos;s sidewall or in your vehicle handbook, and you should
                  always follow those figures for your car.

                  What Are the UK Rules on Driving With a Spare Tyre?
                </h2>
                <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  UK law does not set one fixed &quot;maximum distance&quot; for spare tyres.
                  Instead, the general legal requirements are that:
                </p>
                <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 leading-7 text-zinc-600">

                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  Driving with illegal or unsafe tyres can lead to penalty points and fines, so it
                  is important not to ignore the manufacturer&apos;s limits on a temporary spare.
                  Using a space-saver beyond its limits can also affect your insurance if it
                  contributes to an accident.

                  A spare tyre is a short-term fix. A temporary space-saver generally means no
                  more than about 50 mph and a limited distance, and you should get the damaged
                  tyre replaced as soon as you safely can. Always check the limits on your spare
                  and in your handbook.
