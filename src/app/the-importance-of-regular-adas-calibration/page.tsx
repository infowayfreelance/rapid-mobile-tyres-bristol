  },
  {
    question: "Why does ADAS need calibrating?",

      "The cameras and sensors must point in precisely the right direction to read the road accurately. Repairs, impacts and alignment changes can shift them slightly, which can affect how well the systems work.",
  },
  {
    question: "When is ADAS calibration needed?",
    answer:
      "Commonly after a windscreen replacement, collision repair, bumper or sensor work, wheel alignment or suspension changes, or when a warning light appears. Check your handbook or ask a specialist.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does changing a tyre affect ADAS calibration?",
    answer:
      "Usually, a like-for-like tyre change does not require calibration, but fitting the wrong size or specification can affect vehicle systems. If alignment or suspension work is also being done, ask whether calibration is needed.",
  },

    question: "Can I calibrate ADAS myself?",

      "Calibration normally requires specialist equipment, a controlled setup and manufacturer procedures, so it is usually done by a qualified technician.",

    question: "Do you offer ADAS calibration?",

      "No. Rapid Mobile Tyres provides mobile tyre fitting. For calibration, we recommend contacting a qualified specialist or your manufacturer's approved repairer.",

                Modern cars are packed with safety technology. Cameras, radar and sensors help you
                brake in an emergency, stay in your lane, keep a safe distance and avoid hazards
                you might miss. These are known as ADAS, or Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.

                But these systems only work properly if their sensors are positioned and aligned

                is, why it matters, when your car may need it, and how your tyres and wheel
                alignment fit into the picture.

                  ADAS covers a range of features designed to help the driver and reduce the risk
                  of accidents. Depending on your vehicle, these might include:

                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  These systems rely on forward-facing cameras, radar units, ultrasonic sensors
                  and other hardware fitted around the car, often behind the windscreen, in the
                  bumpers and in the mirrors.

                <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  ADAS calibration is the process of checking and adjusting these sensors and
                  cameras so they see the road exactly as the manufacturer intended. Even a very
                  small change in angle can affect what a sensor &quot;sees&quot; and how
                  accurately the system reacts, particularly at distance.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  Calibration is usually carried out by a specialist using manufacturer-approved
                  equipment and procedures. It generally falls into two types:
                </p>
                <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Static calibration,</strong> carried out in a workshop using targets
                    and measuring equipment while the car is stationary.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Dynamic calibration,</strong> carried out on the road under specific
                    conditions, with diagnostic equipment connected to the car.

                </ul>
                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  Some vehicles need one type, some need both. The correct procedure depends on

                <p className="mb-5 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  ADAS is not only about cameras and radar. Your car&apos;s wheels and tyres also
                  play a part in how these systems perform.

                    <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                      Many ADAS systems assume the car is tracking straight and level. If wheel
                      alignment is out, for example after hitting a pothole or kerb, or after
                      suspension work, the car&apos;s &quot;straight ahead&quot; direction may
                      differ from where the sensors are pointing. Manufacturers often require
                      alignment to be correct before calibration, and some alignment work can
                      trigger the need for recalibration.

                    <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                      Fitting tyres that do not match the manufacturer&apos;s specification can
                      affect things like rolling circumference, speed sensing and load handling,
                      which in turn can affect how systems calculate distance and speed. Always
                      fit tyres of the correct size, load and speed rating for your vehicle.

                      handling. Systems such as automatic emergency braking work best when the

                <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  In most cases, simply replacing a tyre with the correct size and specification
                  does not by itself require ADAS calibration. Calibration is more often needed
                  after work that affects sensor position or alignment, such as windscreen
                  replacement, collision repair, alignment adjustment or suspension work. However,
                  requirements differ between manufacturers, so check your handbook or ask a
                  qualified specialist if you are unsure.

                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  If your car has had alignment or suspension work done along with a tyre change,
                  ask the workshop whether calibration is needed.
