If you can see the outer band, check the tyre more carefully with a proper tread gauge or ask a tyre professional. The 20p test is only a quick guide.

  "Worn or damaged tyres can also be more likely to develop problems while driving. Cracks, bulges, cuts, or very low tread should never be ignored.",

                Knowing when to replace tyres is important for keeping your car safe on the road.
                Good tyres help your car grip the road, turn safely, and stop when you need it to.

              <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                Tyres wear down over time. They can also get cuts, cracks, bulges, or uneven wear.
                If these problems are ignored, the tyre may become unsafe to use. UK drivers should
                check their tyres often, not only when there is a problem. Simple checks can help
                you spot worn or damaged tyres before they become a bigger risk.

                  What Is the Legal Tyre Tread Depth in the UK?
                </h2>
                <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  For cars and light vans in the UK, the legal minimum tyre tread depth is{" "}
                  <strong>1.6 mm</strong>. This tread must cover the central three-quarters of the
                  tyre and continue around the full tyre. Your tyres must also be free from
                  serious cuts, bulges, and other defects. You are responsible for making sure
                  your vehicle is safe to drive, even if it already has a valid MOT.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  Drivers should check tyre tread regularly instead of waiting until it is very
                  low. A simple visual check can help, but a proper tread depth gauge gives a more
                  accurate reading.

                </h3>
                <p className="mt-1 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  A tyre can still have 1.6 mm of tread and show other signs of damage. Cracks,
                  bulges, uneven wear, or pressure problems can still make it unsafe. This is why
                  you should check the whole tyre, not just the tread depth. If you are unsure
                  about the condition of a tyre, have it inspected before driving further.

                <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  Yes, tyre age matters. A tyre can still have good tread but become weaker as it
                  gets older. Rubber can slowly dry out, harden, or crack over time. Heat,
                  weather, sunlight, and how the car is stored can all affect the tyre.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  You can usually find the tyre&apos;s manufacturing date on the sidewall. It is
                  shown as a four-digit code, with the first two numbers showing the week and the
                  last two showing the year.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  Tyre age alone does not always tell you if a tyre must be replaced. The full
                  condition of the tyre matters too. Check older tyres for cracks, damage, uneven
                  wear, and changes in the rubber. If you are not sure about an older tyre, ask a
                  tyre professional to inspect it. Regular checks are more important than waiting
                  for the tyre to look completely worn out.

                </h2>
                <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  Not every damaged tyre needs to be replaced. Some punctures can be repaired, but
                  it depends on where the damage is and how serious it is.
                </p>
                <h3 className="mt-4 font-semibold text-zinc-900">When a Repair May Be Possible</h3>
                <p className="mt-1 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  A small puncture in the main tread area may sometimes be repairable. The tyre
                  must also be in good condition and have enough tread left. A tyre professional
                  should always inspect the damage first. This helps make sure the repair is safe.
                </p>
                <h3 className="mt-4 font-semibold text-zinc-900">When Replacement May Be Needed</h3>
                <p className="mt-1 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  A tyre may need replacing if it has serious sidewall damage, a bulge, deep cuts,
                  or very low tread. Replacement may also be the safer choice if the tyre has
                  several problems or has been badly damaged. If you cannot safely drive to a
                  garage, a mobile tyre fitting service can help replace the tyre where your car
                  is parked.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  Never guess if a damaged tyre is safe. If you are unsure, have it checked before
                  driving again.

                  If you notice a tyre problem while driving, stay calm and slow down carefully.
                  Avoid sudden steering or hard braking if you can.

                <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                  Find a safe place to stop away from moving traffic. Turn on your hazard lights

                  Do not keep driving if the tyre looks badly damaged, flat, or unsafe. Driving
                  further can make the damage worse and may put you at risk. If you are on a
                  motorway, move to a safe place where possible and do not try to repair or change
                  a tyre in a dangerous location.

                  Knowing when to replace tyres can help you avoid bigger problems on the road.
                  Check the tread, pressure, tyre age, and look for cuts, cracks, bulges, or
                  uneven wear.

                  If a tyre looks unsafe, do not wait for it to fail. Get it checked and replace
                  it when needed. Regular tyre checks are simple, quick, and important for safer
                  driving. If you are unsure about a tyre, getting professional help is the
                  safest choice.
