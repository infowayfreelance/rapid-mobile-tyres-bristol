        <p>The biggest change in tyre services is simple: the service now comes to you.</p>
        <p>
          Drivers are busier than ever. Taking a car to a garage can mean losing half a day,
          arranging lifts or taking time off work. Mobile tyre fitting removes all of that. A
          fully equipped van arrives at your home, workplace or a suitable roadside location, and
          the job is done on the spot.
        </p>
        <p>This model is especially valuable for:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>Emergencies such as punctures and blowouts, where driving to a garage is unsafe</li>
          <li>Busy professionals who cannot spare the time</li>
          <li>Van and fleet drivers who need to keep working</li>
          <li>Families and vulnerable drivers who would rather not wait at the roadside</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As expectations around convenience keep growing, mobile services are likely to keep
          growing with them. You can see how this works with our{" "}

          service.

    title: "2. Smart Tyres and Sensor Technology",
    body: (
      <>
        <p>
          Tyres are getting smarter. Many modern vehicles already use tyre pressure monitoring
          systems (TPMS), which warn you when pressure drops. The wider industry is also
          developing tyres with built-in sensors that can track things like pressure, temperature
          and wear.
        </p>
        <p>What this could mean for drivers:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>Earlier warnings about slow punctures and under-inflation</li>
          <li>Better data on when tyres need replacing</li>
          <li>Fewer unexpected breakdowns</li>
          <li>More accurate wear and maintenance planning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As this technology becomes more common, fitters need the right tools and knowledge to
          handle sensors properly during tyre changes.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    title: "3. The Rise of Electric Vehicles and EV-Specific Tyres",
    body: (
      <>
        <p>
          Electric vehicles are becoming more common on UK roads, and they place different
          demands on tyres. EVs are typically heavier and deliver instant torque, which can mean
          faster tyre wear. Manufacturers now offer tyres designed for EVs, focusing on:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>Higher load capacity</li>
          <li>Lower rolling resistance to help efficiency</li>
          <li>Reduced road noise</li>
          <li>Durability under strong acceleration</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For drivers, this makes choosing the right tyre more important than ever. A good fitter
          should be able to explain the options and recommend a tyre that suits your vehicle and
          how you use it.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    title: "4. Run-Flat Tyres and Fewer Spare Wheels",
    body: (
      <p>
        Many new cars no longer carry a spare wheel. Instead, they come with a repair kit or
        run-flat tyres. This changes what happens after a puncture. Without a spare, drivers are
        more likely to need professional help on the day. That is one reason roadside and mobile
        support is becoming more important. If you are not sure what you can do with a spare,
        read our guide on{" "}

  },
  {
    title: "5. Sustainability and Greener Tyres",
    body: (
      <>
        <p>Environmental concerns are influencing the industry too. Trends include:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>Longer-lasting tyres that reduce waste</li>
          <li>Lower rolling resistance designs that help improve fuel or energy efficiency</li>
          <li>Recycled and sustainable materials being explored by manufacturers</li>
          <li>Better recycling of old tyres</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For drivers, simple habits also help, such as keeping tyres correctly inflated,
          rotating them when advised and replacing them before they become unsafe.

      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    title: "6. Digital Booking and Faster Communication",
    body: (
      <>
        <p>
          Customers now expect to book and get answers quickly, whether by phone, WhatsApp, email
          or online. Quick quotes, clear communication and instant receipts are fast becoming
          standard rather than a bonus. Drivers want to know:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>How much will it cost?</li>
          <li>When will someone arrive?</li>
          <li>Can I pay easily?</li>
          <li>Will I get a receipt?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Services that answer these questions clearly and quickly are the ones people trust.</p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    title: "7. Transparent Pricing",
    body: (
      <p>
        Another big shift is the demand for upfront, honest pricing. Drivers no longer want vague
        estimates or hidden extras. They want a clear price for the tyre, the fitting and any
        extras before work begins. If you want to know what affects the price, see our guide to{" "}
