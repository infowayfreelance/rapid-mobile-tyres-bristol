                  Switch on your hazard warning lights as soon as you realise there is a problem.
                  Then look for the safest place to pull over, for example:

                  Try not to stop on a bend, a hill crest or anywhere other drivers cannot see you
                  easily. If you can safely reach a flat, quiet spot, even driving slowly for a
                  very short distance is usually better than stopping in a dangerous location, but
                  avoid driving far on a flat tyre as it can damage the wheel.

                    <p className="leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                      Many modern cars have a sealant and inflator kit instead of a spare. These
                      can be a very short-term fix for small punctures in the tread, but they are
                      not suitable for all damage, and the tyre should be checked soon after.

                      If you have breakdown cover, you can call your provider. Be aware that
                      waiting times vary, and they may only be able to fit your spare rather than
                      replace the tyre.
